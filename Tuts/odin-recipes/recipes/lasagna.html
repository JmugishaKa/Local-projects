    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    
    <p>
        In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating
        with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses 
        (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. 
        The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking.
    </p>

        <li> Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</li>
        
<p>
       
In a large pan over medium heat, sauté onion and garlic until soft (2–3 mins).

Add ground beef, cook until browned.

Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs, salt, and pepper.

Simmer for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

</p>

<li>Step 2: Cook the Lasagna Noodles</li>
<p>
If using regular noodles: boil according to package instructions, then drain and lay flat to cool.

If oven-ready: skip this step.
</p>
<li>Step 3: Mix the Cheese Filling</li>
<p>
 In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg (optional), and half of the Parmesan cheese.   
</p>

<li>Step 4: Layer the Lasagna</li>
<p>In a baking dish:

Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.

Add a layer of noodles.

Spread cheese mixture over noodles.

Sprinkle with mozzarella.

Repeat layers: sauce → noodles → cheese → mozzarella.

Top with remaining meat sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
</p>

<li>Step 5: Bake</li>
<p>
Cover with foil (to prevent burning).

Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 30 minutes.

Remove foil, bake another 10–15 minutes until bubbly and golden.    
</p>

<li>Step 6: Cool & Serve</li>
<p>
Let lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before cutting. This helps it hold together.
